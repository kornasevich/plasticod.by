На нашем сайте вы можете\\n        приобрести также перегородки к выдвижным ячейкам, которые разделяя рабочее пространство ячейки, позволяют в\\n        одной ячейке, хранить несколько типов изделий, товаров. Сами ячейки выполнены из прозрачного пластика, что\\n        позволяет быстро искать и опознавать нужный товар. Ручки ячеек выполнены таким образом, что на них удобно\\n        размещать, наклеивать названия товаров, их артикулы и коды.\\n        Уникальной особенностью пластиковых органайзеров с выдвижными ячейками является их способность стыковаться с\\n        однотипными органайзерами и друг с другом. Такая возможность возможна благодаря направляющим, которые\\n        расположены на всех внешних сторонах органайзера. Благодаря этому можно создавать целые шкафы-стеллажи ячеек. В\\n        таких конструкциях могут быть собраны однотипные органайзеры с различным количеством выдвижных ячеек. Это\\n        позволяет организовать работу с товаром на складе, в магазине, в офисе максимально удобным и эргономичным\\n        способом.'\r\n        }),\r\n        created() {\r\n
